=== head_to_the_gp ===

You decide that you should meet the person who requested your organisation's presence in town and begin to head toward the address you were given in the letter. 
You come walk down the main street to the far end of town until you eventually arrive at a little white cottage that has an old unused gas lantern out the front, the kind that reminds of the representation of streets in Victorian England. Next to it, just above a white picket fence, is a white mailbox with the number 67 on it. There is a sign on the fence gate that says DR.ANDREW SCHOLSON - CROWSHURST GP. You push through the gate and walk past a neatly maintained garden of flowers up to the front door. 
*Knock and enter.
After you knock you hair a faint voice from within call out, "its open." 
You push the door and it swings open easily enough.

*Return to the main Street.
You decide that you have other things to do and see first and retrace your steps back to the street.

=== doctors_lobby ===
The waiting room is clean and well kept, with a receptionist sitting behind a small desk with a computer, phone and collection of old filling draws behind here. There is a table in the middle of the room piled full of the usual kinds of doctor's waiting room magazines. To the right is the normal assortment of children's toys in a little play area. To the left there is a set of aqua coloured felt sofas with an old man sitting on the far right one, he appears to be asleep. 
You walk up to the receptionist and hand her the letter you were sent. 
She talks a moment to read it before smiling and quietly indicating that you should take a seat and wait.

* Read a magazine
You reach over and begin to flick through a handful of magazines, but none really capture your interest.

+ Leave
Tired of waiting you decide to come back later, and head out back to the main street.
